## 👋 About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at [Shanghai Jiaotong University], specializing in **synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image analysis**, **image fusion**, and **multimodal learning**.  
My research focuses on integrating radar and optical data for enhanced image interpretation, leveraging deep learning and vision-language models.

I am particularly interested in:
- Multi-modal image fusion and registration  
- Radar–optical joint representation learning  
- Vision-language grounding for SAR image understanding  
- Self-supervised and cross-modal distillation methods  

## 🧪 Research Vision
My goal is to make **SAR image interpretation more explainable** by combining physical priors of radar imaging with semantic reasoning from large vision-language models.
